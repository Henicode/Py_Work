Barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes.
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes. David had promised that he would be on time today.
He never was, but he had promised this one time. She had made him repeat the promise multiple times 
over the last week until she'd believed his promise. Now she was paying the price.
It was going to rain. The weather forecast didn't say that, but the steel plate in his hip did.
He had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman. It was going to rain, so he
better get outside and prepare.
It went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it
so many times he became confused in the darkness, and could not, for the life of him, tell
whether he held the sheep right side up, or upside down. But that point was decided for him a moment
later by the animal itself, who, with a sudden twist, jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs
that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust.
Hopes and dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock.
The warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually
happen. That possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny.
That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came crashing down.
